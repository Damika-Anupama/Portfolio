                <h4>FlashGuard</h4>
                <p>
                  The University of Moratuwa's Team FlashGuard, which includes me and three of my friends, Sasmitha
                  Manathunga, Anuki Pasqual and Supun Dasantha Kuruppu, devised the FlashGuard project, which suggests
                  developing smart glasses that will
                  safeguard people with photosensitive epilepsy in real time. The glasses utilize a combination of a
                  camera, microcontroller, and electrochromic glass lenses to detect potential seizure triggers and
                  promptly darken the lenses to prevent harm to the user. The project aims to significantly improve the
                  quality of life for those with photosensitive epilepsy, allowing them to engage in daily activities
                  without constant concern about seizures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  FlashGuard mobile application is included with the suggested device, FlashGuard, which functions when
                  combined
                  with the glasses. The app allows users to fine-tune detection settings, provide feedback on the
                  effectiveness of the glasses, and view a history of triggers and feedback. The device's functionality
                  involves real-time video processing, cloud connectivity, and data analysis to optimize parameters
                  based on user conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Currently we're using core technologies such as an ESP32 camera microcontroller, OpenCV library for
                  video processing, React Native framework for the mobile app, and Azure web services for cloud
                  connectivity and data analysis. The business plan includes developing a working prototype, testing it
                  with a small group of individuals with photosensitive epilepsy, obtaining regulatory approval, and
                  eventually commercializing the product. The team envisions sustaining the business through a
                  subscription fee to cover cloud services and customization, aiming to continually improve the device
                  through ongoing research and development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  FlashGuard aims to address a gap in the market, as there are currently no similar products offering
                  real-time protection against photosensitive epileptic triggers. With a focus on innovation and the
                  potential positive impact on individuals with photosensitive epilepsy, the project anticipates
                  commercial viability and success in the market with regulatory approval and successful testing.
                </p>

                  I must express my gratitude to Professor Dilshani Dissanayaka of the physiology department of the
                  medical faculty of Columbo University in Sri Lanka in the interim. She advised and assisted us thus
                  far in developing this concept and testing the MVP at the physiologyÂ department utilizing EEG devices.
                  I am grateful to my sister Armandi Nanayakkara, who studied under Professor Dilshani at the Colombo
                  Medical Faculty. It was Armandi who made contact with us, Professor Dilshani. A special thanks goes
                  out to professor Chandana Gamage fromÂ the computer science and engineering department at the
                  University of Moratuwa in Sri Lanka, who assisted us in refining our MVP and offering guidance when we
                  applied the idea for the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2023.
