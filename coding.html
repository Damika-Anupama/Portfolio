                    I attended Mahinda College for my first through thirteen grades. I finished my primary, secondary, and high school education there. 
                    Mahinda College is one of the schools with the most exquisite environments in Sri Lanka . This national school is renowned in Galle due to its longstanding association with the Buddhist school education system in Sri Lanka and its annual cricket match with Galle Richmond College which also has a long history.
                    The most breathtaking architectural features of Mahinda College may be found in Olcott Hall, the school's main hall named for Colonel Henry Steel Olcott.

                    I enrolled in university in August of 2021. Unfortunately, we had to begin our university education online due to the COVID-19 pandemic at that time. Thus, regrettably, our time at university wasn't particularly pleasant. After earning enough results in the first semester examination, I got selected into the computer science engineering department.

                    I played the acoustic guitar at Thotupola 2022 and was a member of the university's classical music society during my time there. In addition, I took part in the university gavel club, where I gained experience in public speaking and even in one-on-one conversations. That enabled me to speak English more fluently. I was involved in the university Leo club and assisted in organizing the "Abhi Roo" musical event.

                    At the university, I participated in table tennis and rowing as sports. Due to the pandemic, the university was only partially operational when I started rowing, so we had to practice at the Diyawannawa and Columbo rowing clubs. which, in my life, was an amazing experience.
