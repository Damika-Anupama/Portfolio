                  <h4>Mahinda College Galle<br>Sri Lanka</h4>
                  <p>
                    I attended Mahinda College for my first through thirteen grades. I finished my primary, secondary, and high school education there. 
                    Mahinda College is one of the schools with the most exquisite environments in Sri Lanka . This national school is renowned in Galle due to its longstanding association with the Buddhist school education system in Sri Lanka and its annual cricket match with Galle Richmond College which also has a long history.
                    The most breathtaking architectural features of Mahinda College may be found in Olcott Hall, the school's main hall named for Colonel Henry Steel Olcott.                    
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I passed the three major examinations conducted by the Sri Lankan educational system while I was in school.
                    <ol style="color: white; list-style-type: square;">
                        <li>I got 164 out of 200 points in Grade 5 Government Scholarship; 148 was the cutoff.</li>
                        <li>I passed the General Certificate of Education-Ordinary Level (GCE O/L) after finishing my secondary school education, earning passes in the following subjects: Mathematics, Science, English, History, Sinhala Language and Literature, Buddhism, Information and Communication Technology, Tamil Language, and English Literary Texts.</li>
                        <li>Finally, I passed the Physical Stream in GCE A/L (General Certificate of Education - Advance Level) with flying colors, earning three As in Combined Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. I was ranked 298th on the island and 19th in my district. Got selected into University of Moratuwa, Best engineering university in Sri Lanka.</li>

                    Extra curriculum activities during the school education.
                    <ol style="color: white; list-style-type: square;">
                        <li>Chess was my primary extracurricular activity. From third grade to thirteen, I played chess on the school team. I served as the team vice-captain in couple of years. In several times we won the championship, 1st runner-up and 2nd runner-up in all island chess championship.</li>
                        <li>I played my violin in school ochestra. Mainly performed in Poson Bhakthi Geetha, held in school Olcott hall</li>
                        <li>Furthermore, I played table scouting, tennis, baseball and basketball in the school.</li>

                  <p>
                    School science section was the place where I spend last 3 of my years in school. School chemistry lab, physics lab, chemistry auditorium, physics auditorium, main library, basket ball ground and olcott hall are my favourite places. After getting selected to university we did a chemistry and physics practical workshop for incomming advance level cohort.

                    I enrolled in university in August of 2021. Unfortunately, we had to begin our university education online due to the COVID-19 pandemic at that time. Thus, regrettably, our time at university wasn't particularly pleasant. After earning enough results in the first semester examination, I got selected into the computer science engineering department.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I played the acoustic guitar at Thotupola 2022 and was a member of the university's classical music society during my time there. In addition, I took part in the university gavel club, where I gained experience in public speaking and even in one-on-one conversations. That enabled me to speak English more fluently. I was involved in the university Leo club and assisted in organizing the "Abhi Roo" musical event.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the university, I participated in table tennis and rowing as sports. Due to the pandemic, the university was only partially operational when I started rowing, so we had to practice at the Diyawannawa and Columbo rowing clubs. which, in my life, was an amazing experience.
