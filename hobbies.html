                <h4>Play Music Instruments</h4>
                <p>
                  I am a three-instrumentalist. They are the violin and tabla, two eastern musical instruments, and the
                  acoustic guitar. In sixth grade, I began to play the violin and tabla. I now hold a Praveshika
                  certificate in both tabla and violin. In addition, I'm like the rhythm that comes from my music. In
                  the orchestras at my school and university, I played violin and guitar, respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I started
                  playing the guitar mostly to socialize with people, especially on picnics and trips.Playing these
                  instruments truly helps me de-stress from programming and academics.

                  I enrolled in university in August of 2021. Unfortunately, we had to begin our university education
                  online due to the COVID-19 pandemic at that time. Thus, regrettably, our time at university wasn't
                  particularly pleasant. After earning enough results¬†in the first semester examination, I got
                  selected¬†into the computer science engineering department.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I played the acoustic guitar at Thotupola 2022 and was a member of the university's classical music
                  society during my time there. In addition, I took part in the university gavel club, where I gained
                  experience in public speaking and even in one-on-one conversations. That enabled me to speak English
                  more fluently. I was involved in the university Leo club and assisted in organizing the "Abhi Roo"
                  musical event.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the university, I participated in table tennis and rowing as sports. Due to the pandemic, the
                  university was only partially operational when I started rowing, so we had to practice at the
                  Diyawannawa and Columbo rowing clubs. which, in my life, was an amazing experience.

                  I used NetBeans and IntelliJ IJEA IDEs when I first started studying full stack with java, spring
                  boot, mysql, and angular cli. I made use of android studio since I used JavaFX mobile to develop
                  android apps using the JavaFX library. Later, I entirely switched to Visual Studio Code for any
                  programming language, technology, or framework because it contains an incredible range of libraries
                  and works with any technology.
