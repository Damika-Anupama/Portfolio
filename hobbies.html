                <h4>Play Music Instruments</h4>
                <p>
                  I am a three-instrumentalist. They are the violin and tabla, two eastern musical instruments, and the
                  acoustic guitar. In sixth grade, I began to play the violin and tabla. I now hold a Praveshika
                  certificate in both tabla and violin. In addition, I'm like the rhythm that comes from my music. In
                  the orchestras at my school and university, I played violin and guitar, respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I started
                  playing the guitar mostly to socialize with people, especially on picnics and trips.Playing these
                  instruments truly helps me de-stress from programming and academics.

                <h4>Play Chess</h4>
                <p>
                  My favorite game is chess. I began playing chess at the age of seven. My primary goal at the moment
                  was to be chosen for my school's chess team. I could be able to enter¬†my school's chess team the
                  following year. I continued the run all the way to the end of my academic career in school,
                  maintaining my position on the chess team. I had the opportunity to serve as the team's vice captain a
                  few times. We placed first, second, and third in the Sri Lankan all-island school chess competition a
                  few times.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to expand my chess knowledge, I also participated in international chess tournaments, played
                  online chess games on the Chess Cube website, and solved chess puzzles. I am rated as an international
                  chess player. In this sense, I will always remember playing chess as a part of my life. I'm currently
                  maintaining decent rapid blitz, and bullet chess ratings while playing on the chess.com website.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most valuable lessons I took away from playing chess were how to work as a team, respect people,
                  stay focused on my task, and consider my options before acting and so on.

                <h4>Reading Books</h4>
                <p>
                  Occasionally, I read books.¬†I don't¬†have any specific¬†preference¬†or area. A book that really catch my
                  attention¬†be a novel, detective story, short story, personal finance book, or anything else. I always
                  strive to broaden my vocabulary in English, learn about different cultures around the world, and
                  develop my ability to imagine and thinking through¬†the meaning behind the words in books. I currently
                  read PDFs on my laptop or iPad because they are easy to read. There are a few valuable books in this
                  picture that are crucial for personal growth. Hope these would be helpful to you too

                <h4>Watching TV Series and Movies</h4>
                <p>
                  In my spare time, I like to watch and enjoy TV shows and movies. I've added a few truly fantastic
                  series that I've watched in this poster. Similar to reading books, I use watching movies to improve my
                  vocabulary, use my imagination, and sharpen my thinking.

                <h4>Learning Languages</h4>
                <p>
                  I adore picking up new languages and literature. I enjoy examining the ways in which various
                  linguistics interact and deriving their combinations. Tamil was an elective I took in school. Sadly,
                  though, I was unable to finish Tamil. I then began studying French on my own. I decided to study
                  Mandarin as my humanities module in university. With the aid of the mobile¬†app¬†Duolingo, I'm
                  continuing my study of Chinese and French by listening to conversations in both languages. To become
                  fluent in these two languages is my aim.

                <p>
                  According to my life of programming, I don't play sports very often, thus I have to spend most of my
                  time in front of my laptop. But I'm a huge sports fan. I participated in baseball, table tennis,
                  football, basketball, and badminton at school. A few months after arriving at the university, I took
                  part in rowing sessions.
