                <h4>Life at WealthOS</h4>
                <p>
                  I joined the company in December 2023 as a full stack software engineer intern. I'm working with a
                  team of experienced engineers, product managers, and subject matter experts. The company follows agile
                  methodologies and uses tools and services to facilitate communication and collaboration. I'm working
                  on a cloud-native platform built on cutting-edge serverless technology using AWS Lambdas. The
                  Operations Center is built on React, and the platform exposes well-designed REST APIs for integrating
                  with third-party providers and services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The staff members at WealthOS are very friendly and helpful. They come from diverse backgrounds, and
                  they are always willing to lend a helping hand. The working place is new and modern, with
                  state-of-the-art facilities that are designed to help me work efficiently and comfortably.
