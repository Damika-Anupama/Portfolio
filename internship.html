                <h4>University of Moratuwa<br> Sri Lanka</h4>
                <p>
                  I enrolled in university in August of 2021. Unfortunately, we had to begin our university education
                  online due to the COVID-19 pandemic at that time. Thus, regrettably, our time at university wasn't
                  particularly pleasant. After earning enough results in the first semester examination, I got
                  selected into the computer science engineering department.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I played the acoustic guitar at Thotupola 2022 and was a member of the university's classical music
                  society during my time there. In addition, I took part in the university gavel club, where I gained
                  experience in public speaking and even in one-on-one conversations. That enabled me to speak English
                  more fluently. I was involved in the university Leo club and assisted in organizing the "Abhi Roo"
                  musical event.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the university, I participated in table tennis and rowing as sports. Due to the pandemic, the
                  university was only partially operational when I started rowing, so we had to practice at the
                  Diyawannawa and Columbo rowing clubs. which, in my life, was an amazing experience.
